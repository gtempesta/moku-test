# Moku Test
A test I made for [moku](https://www.moku.io/it), an agency based in Treviso, Italy.

The code uses the AngularJS framework because at that time I only had working experience with that framework. The app fetches beers from an open api `https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers`.

In order to see the test, you need to create a local server from the base folder. 

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) you can find some guidance on how to set up a local server. 

For example, if you want to run a pyhton server and you have python 3 installed, you just need to `cd` into the folder, run `python3 -m http.server` and then navigate to `localhost:8000`.
